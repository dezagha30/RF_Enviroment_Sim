# RF_Enviroment_Sim
This project is part of my thesis for my masters year at Maynooth University. This repository contains NS3 code for simulating an LTE enviroment to demonstrate situations where UE would need to switch between 4G and 5G networks. The ultimate aim is to design a 4G and 5G antenna Array.
